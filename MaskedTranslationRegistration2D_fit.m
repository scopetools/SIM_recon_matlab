% [transform,maxC,C,numberOfOverlapMaskedPixels] =
% MaskedTranslationRegistration(fixedImage,movingImage,fixedMask,movingMask,overlapRatio) 
%   Masked FFT normalized cross-correlation registration of movingImage and
%   fixedImage under masks movingMask and fixedMask.
%   movingMask and fixedMask should consist of only 1s and 0s, where 1
%   indicates locations of useful information in the corresponding image,
%   and 0 indicates locations that should be masked (ignored).
%   fixedImage and movingImage need not be the same size, but fixedMask
%   must be the same size as fixedImage, and movingMask must be the same
%   size as movingImage.
%   If a mask is not needed for either the fixedImage or the movingImage,
%   the fixedMask and/or movingMask can be set to an image of all ones of
%   the same size as the corresponding fixedImage and/or movingImage.
%   The optional overlapRatio specifies the number of pixels needed in the
%   overlap region for meaningful results.  It is specified as a ratio of the
%   maximum number of overlap pixels.  Regions in the resulting correlation
%   image that have fewer than this number of pixels will be set to 0.
